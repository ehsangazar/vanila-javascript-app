# Vanila Front End

Build a static page (`index.html`) that fetches last week's popular items from the [Github Market API](http://marketplace.envato.com/api/documentation) and displays them according to `mockup.png`.

Your data source is `http://marketplace.envato.com/api/edge/popular:themeforest.json`. CORS is enabled on this API.

- List items in order of rating, from highest to lowest.

- Show each item's thumbnail image, name and rating. The name and image should link to the item's URL.

- 5-star items should have a yellow background, as shown in the mockup.

- The page should be responsive.

- Clicking an item's `remove` link should remove it from the list (purely client side, this doesn't need to be communicated to the server or maintained across page reloads).
